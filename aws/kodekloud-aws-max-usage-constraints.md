# KodeKloud AWS Playground Maximum Usage Constraints

This document outlines the constraints and limitations when using the KodeKloud AWS playground environment, along with strategies to maximize resource usage within those limits.

## General Constraints

### Account Limitations
- **Account Type**: AWS Sandbox/Educational Account
- **Region Restrictions**: Limited to specific regions (typically us-east-1, us-west-2)
- **Time Limits**: Sessions typically last 2-4 hours before auto-termination
- **Concurrent Sessions**: Usually limited to 1-2 active sessions per user

### Resource Quotas

#### Compute Resources
- **EC2 Instances**: 
  - Maximum 5-10 instances per session
  - Instance types limited to t2.micro, t2.small (free tier eligible)
  - No GPU or high-memory instances
  - Auto-stop after session timeout

#### Storage Resources
- **EBS Volumes**:
  - Limited to 30GB total storage
  - GP2 volumes only
  - No provisioned IOPS
- **S3 Buckets**:
  - Maximum 5-10 buckets per session
  - Limited to 5GB total storage
  - No cross-region replication

#### Network Resources
- **VPC**: Maximum 2-3 VPCs per session
- **Subnets**: Up to 6 subnets per VPC
- **Security Groups**: Maximum 10-15 security groups
- **Load Balancers**: Limited to 1-2 ALB/NLB
- **NAT Gateways**: Usually not available or limited to 1

#### Database Resources
- **RDS**: 
  - Limited to t2.micro instances
  - Maximum 1-2 instances
  - MySQL, PostgreSQL supported
  - No multi-AZ deployments
- **DynamoDB**: Limited throughput capacity

## Maximum Usage Strategies

### Compute Optimization
1. **Instance Distribution**:
   - Deploy maximum allowed instances (typically 5)
   - Use t2.micro for cost efficiency
   - Distribute across multiple AZs

2. **Auto Scaling Groups**:
   - Create ASGs with min/max within limits
   - Use scaling policies for demonstration

### Network Architecture
1. **Multi-AZ Deployment**:
   - Create subnets in 3 availability zones
   - Implement both public and private subnets
   - Maximum subnet utilization within VPC limits

2. **Security Groups**:
   - Create granular security groups for different tiers
   - Web, application, and database security groups
   - Demonstrate security best practices

### Storage Utilization
1. **EBS Strategy**:
   - Attach additional EBS volumes to instances
   - Demonstrate different volume types
   - Create snapshots for backup scenarios

2. **S3 Usage**:
   - Create multiple buckets for different purposes
   - Implement lifecycle policies
   - Use versioning and encryption

### Service Integration
1. **Load Balancing**:
   - Deploy Application Load Balancer
   - Configure target groups and health checks
   - Implement SSL/TLS termination

2. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Enable CloudWatch monitoring
   - Create custom metrics and alarms
   - Use CloudTrail for audit logging

## Common Limitations to Work Around

### Resource Limits
- **Elastic IPs**: Usually limited to 1-2 per session
- **Internet Gateways**: One per VPC
- **Route Tables**: Limited but sufficient for multi-tier architecture

### Service Restrictions
- **IAM**: Limited permissions for certain actions
- **CloudFormation**: May have stack limits
- **Lambda**: Limited concurrent executions
- **API Gateway**: Basic usage only

## Best Practices for Playground Usage

### Resource Management
1. **Tag Everything**: Proper tagging for resource management
2. **Cost Awareness**: Even in playground, understand resource costs
3. **Clean Up**: Remove resources after testing (though auto-cleanup occurs)

### Learning Objectives
1. **Multi-Tier Architecture**: Demonstrate web, app, and data tiers
2. **High Availability**: Use multiple AZs where possible
3. **Security**: Implement security groups, NACLs, and encryption
4. **Monitoring**: Set up basic CloudWatch monitoring

### Time Management
1. **Session Planning**: Plan deployments within session time limits
2. **Documentation**: Document configurations for future reference
3. **Testing**: Verify configurations work within playground constraints

## Terraform Configuration Notes

### Provider Configuration
```hcl
# Use default region or playground-allowed regions
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Typically allowed region
}
```

### Resource Sizing
```hcl
# Stick to free-tier eligible instances
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  # ... other configuration
}
```

### Count and For_Each Usage
```hcl
# Maximize resource usage within limits
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  count = 3  # Adjust based on playground limits
  # ... configuration
}
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Resource Creation Failures
- **Insufficient Capacity**: Try different AZs
- **Quota Exceeded**: Reduce resource counts
- **Permission Denied**: Check IAM permissions

### Network Connectivity Issues
- **Internet Access**: Ensure Internet Gateway and routing
- **Security Groups**: Verify inbound/outbound rules
- **NACLs**: Check Network ACL configurations

### Session Management
- **Timeout Prevention**: Active monitoring of session time
- **Resource Cleanup**: Manual cleanup if auto-cleanup fails
- **State Management**: Save Terraform state appropriately

## Conclusion

The KodeKloud AWS playground provides a constrained but functional environment for learning AWS services. By understanding these limitations and implementing the strategies outlined above, you can maximize resource usage and create meaningful learning experiences within the platform's boundaries.

Remember to always check current playground limitations as they may change, and adapt configurations accordingly.
